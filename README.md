##QUIK TELL // OCTOBER 21ST 2023
------------------------------------------------
This whole project is to further improve my front end understanding as a JavaScript developer.
By utilizing HTML Canvas and new movement animations to make blocks, players and balls move smoother.
My endgame however, is to however to write the whole project into php, with the JS still the same as the one in the "front end" directory.
The php will allow to explore the backend side of web development. Hopefylly interacting with a Datbase and keeping track of high scores.
Who knows maybe I'll end up with a nice looking website. Maybe.
